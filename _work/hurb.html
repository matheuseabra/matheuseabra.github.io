          Clients needed an integration with their main website so clients could see a listing of their current orders. The development team decided to build a client using React as the UI, consuming a set of web-services from a Grails REST API. As defined in the Design phase, the layout was created to be identical with their main website layout, which we did by reusing the same presentational components as the main website.</p>
